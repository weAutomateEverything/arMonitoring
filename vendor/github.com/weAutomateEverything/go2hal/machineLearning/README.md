#HAL Machine Learning Service

We want to be able to store all the requests HAL recieves from automated systems, such as app dynamics, sensu, ect..
Then, we want to log the actions taken by the requests.

Using the data, especially where HAL could not take any action, we want to be able to start using the data to be able
to teach HAL what to do based on a request.
